# About

Revamp of the original "Emojis in Comments" mod by TheSillyDoggo.  
(Note: This mod is a **recreation** and does not use any of the original code)

This mod adds support for emojis in comments and profile posts.
They follow the same format as Discord emojis, which means people without the mod can still know what you're trying to say.


## Usage

To use emojis, either type its placeholder or click the **Cube** icon in the bottom right corner of the comment box to open the emoji picker.


## Changes over the original mod
- A lot of new emojis
- Improved performance and load times of comments
- Fixed several alignment/spacing issues with labels and emojis
- Favorite emojis (press and hold to favorite)
- Frequently used emojis category
- Collapsible categories with sidebar for easy navigation
- Added support for @mentions in comments
